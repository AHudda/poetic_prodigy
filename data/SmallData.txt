Dog bone, stapler,

cribbage board, garlic press

     because this window is loose—lacks

suction, lacks grip.

Bungee cord, bootstrap,

dog leash, leather belt

     because this window had sash cords.

They frayed. They broke.

Feather duster, thatch of straw, empty

bottle of Elmer's glue

     because this window is loud—its hinges clack

open, clack shut.

Stuffed bear, baby blanket,

single crib newel

     because this window is split. It's dividing

in two.

Velvet moss, sagebrush,

willow branch, robin's wing

     because this window, it's pane-less. It's only

a frame of air.

The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone

among fir trees, but it took him an hour

for the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,

the village passed him by, greeted him,

asked about his health, but everybody hurried

to catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,

measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.

He yearned for the day when the new church

would be built—right across the road. Now

it rises above the moon: saints in frescoes

meet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut

through the shingles on the roof of his empty

house. The apple trees have taken over the sky,

sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.

Look for me under the hood

of that old Chevrolet settled in weeds

at the end of the pasture.

I'm the radiator that spent its years

bolted in front of an engine

shoving me forward into the wind.

Whatever was in me in those days

has mostly leaked away,

but my cap's still screwed on tight

and I know the names of all these

tattered moths and broken grasshoppers

the rest of you've forgotten.

Behind the silo, the Mother Rabbit

hunches like a giant spider with strange calm:

six tiny babies beneath, each

clamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.

This may sound cute to you, reading

from your pulpit of plenty,

but one small one was left out of reach,

a knife of fur

barging between the others.

I watched behind a turret of sand. If

I could have cautioned the mother rabbit

I would. If I could summon the

Bunnies to fit him in beneath

the belly's swell

I would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishing

for some equity. This must be

why it's called Wild Life because of all the

crazed emotions tangled up in

the underbrush within us.

Did I tell you how

the smallest one, black and trembling,

hopped behind the kudzu

still filigreed with wanting?

Should we talk now of animal heritage, their species,

creature development? And what do we say

about form and focus—

writing this when a stray goes hungry, and away.
