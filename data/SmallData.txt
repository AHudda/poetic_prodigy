The old cupola glinted above the clouds, shone

among fir trees, but it took him an hour

for the half mile all the way up the hill. As he trailed,

the village passed him by, greeted him,

asked about his health, but everybody hurried

to catch the mass, left him leaning against fences,

measuring the road with the walking stick he sculpted.

He yearned for the day when the new church

would be built—right across the road. Now

it rises above the moon: saints in frescoes

meet the eye, and only the rain has started to cut

through the shingles on the roof of his empty

house. The apple trees have taken over the sky,

sequestered the gate, sidled over the porch.

Behind the silo, the Mother Rabbit

hunches like a giant spider with strange calm:

six tiny babies beneath, each

clamoring for a sweet syringe of milk.

This may sound cute to you, reading

from your pulpit of plenty,

but one small one was left out of reach,

a knife of fur

barging between the others.

I watched behind a turret of sand. If

I could have cautioned the mother rabbit

I would. If I could summon the

Bunnies to fit him in beneath

the belly's swell

I would. But instead, I stood frozen, wishing

crazed emotions tangled up in

the underbrush within us.

If she sees you watching she will invite you in for coffee, give you warm bread, and you will be obligated to stay and listen. But this is no ordinary story. You will have to endure earthquakes, lightning, the deaths of all those you love, the most blinding beauty. It’s a story so compelling you may never want to leave; this is how she traps you.

Is anything central?

Orchards flung out on the land,

Urban forests, rustic plantations, knee-high hills?

Are place names central?

Elm Grove, Adcock Corner, Story Book Farm?

As they concur with a rush at eye level

Beating themselves into eyes which have had enough

Thank you, no more thank you.

And they come on like scenery mingled with darkness

The damp plains, overgrown suburbs,

Places of known civic pride, of civil obscurity.

 

These are connected to my version of America

But the juice is elsewhere.

This morning as I walked out of your room

After breakfast crosshatched with

Backward and forward glances, backward into light,

Forward into unfamiliar light,

Was it our doing, and was it

The material, the lumber of life, or of lives

We were measuring, counting?

A mood soon to be forgotten

In crossed girders of light, cool downtown shadow

In this morning that has seized us again?

 

I know that I braid too much on my own

Snapped-off perceptions of things as they come to me.

They are private and always will be.

Where then are the private turns of event

Destined to bloom later like golden chimes

Released over a city from a highest tower?

The quirky things that happen to me, and I tell you,

And you know instantly what I mean?

What remote orchard reached by winding roads

Hides them? Where are these roots?

 

It is the lumps and trials

That tell us whether we shall be known

And whether our fate can be exemplary, like a star.

All the rest is waiting

For a letter that never arrives,

Day after day, the exasperation

Until finally you have ripped it open not knowing what it is,

The two envelope halves lying on a plate.

The message was wise, and seemingly

Dictated a long time ago, but its time has still

Not arrived, telling of danger, and the mostly limited

Steps that can be taken against danger

Now and in the future, in cool yards,

In quiet small houses in the country,

Our country, in fenced areas, in cool shady streets.

Hour in which I consider hydrangea, a salt or sand plant, varietal, the question of varietals, the diet of every mother I know, 5 pounds feels like 20, I have lost … I have lost, yes, a sense of my own possible beauty, grown external, I externalize beauty. Beauty occurs on the surface of plants; the sun darkens the skin of my child, he is so small, he is beautiful (I can see; it is obvious) and everything about him is beautiful. His hand swells from the bite [spread?] of some insect[’s] venom because he is small. He appears to feel nothing. He smashes his skull against the floor. He screams. I hold him in my lap on the kitchen floor in front of an open freezer, pressing a pack of frozen clay against his forehead. He likes the cold. I see; it is so obvious. Hydrangea. When I move, when I walk pushing my child’s stroller (it is both walking and pushing or hauling, sometimes, also, lifting; it is having another body, an adjunct body composed of errand and weight and tenderness and no small amount of power), I imagine I can feel this small amount of weight, this 5 pounds like 20, interfering with the twitch of every muscle in my body. As an object, a mother is confusing, a middle-aged mother with little spare flesh, I feel every inch of major muscle pulling against gravity and against the weight of my child, now sleeping. This is the hour for thinking hydrangea. Let no man look at me. I stop to brush the drowsy child’s little eye. His face. He barely considers his mother. I am all around him. Why should he consider what is all around him? Perhaps what is missing is a subtle power of differentiation. I am in, therefore, a time of mass apprehensions.

She couldn't help but sting my finger,

She curls into herself, stinger twitching,

gilt wings folded. Her whole life just a few weeks,

In the cold, she hardly had her wits to buzz.

No warning from either of us:

               I got a call from the White House, from the

President himself, asking me if I’d do him a personal

favor. I like the President, so I said, “Sure, Mr.

President, anything you like.” He said, “Just act

like nothing’s going on. Act normal. That would

mean the world to me. Can you do that, Leon?” “Why,

sure, Mr. President, you’ve got it. Normal, that’s

how I’m going to act. I won’t let on, even if I’m

tortured,” I said, immediately regretting that “tortured”

bit. He thanked me several times and hung up. I was

dying to tell someone that the President himself called

me, but I knew I couldn’t. The sudden pressure to

act normal was killing me. And what was going on

anyway. I didn’t know anything was going on. I

saw the President on TV yesterday. He was shaking

hands with a farmer. What if it wasn’t really a

farmer? I needed to buy some milk, but suddenly

I was afraid to go out. I checked what I had on.

I looked “normal” to me, but maybe I looked more

like I was trying to be normal. That’s pretty

suspicious. I opened the door and looked around.

What was going on? There was a car parked in front

of my car that I had never seen before, a car that

was trying to look normal, but I wasn’t fooled.

If you need milk, you have to get milk, otherwise

people will think something’s going on. I got into

my car and sped down the road. I could feel those

little radar guns popping behind every tree and bush,

but, apparently, they were under orders not to stop

me. I ran into Kirsten in the store. “Hey, what’s

going on, Leon?” she said. She had a very nice smile.

I hated to lie to her. “Nothing’s going on. Just

getting milk for my cat,” I said. “I didn’t know

you had a cat,” she said. “I meant to say coffee.

You’re right, I don’t have a cat. Sometimes I

refer to my coffee as my cat. It’s just a private

joke. Sorry,” I said. “Are you all right?” she

asked. “Nothing’s going on, Kirsten. I promise

you. Everything is normal. The President shook

hands with a farmer, a real farmer. Is that such

a big deal?” I said. “I saw that,” she said, “and

that man was definitely not a farmer.” “Yeah, I

know,” I said, feeling better.

the simplest sentences. So much so

that the maligned semicolon

 

became an ardent ally, an island

of pause and the deep breath.

 

The comma, too, bless its tiny soul,

was the crumb which the god

 

of small favors multiplied

tenfold for my morning pie.

 

Before I was an I, knowledge

clung to me like burrs & hunger

 

guided my ship like the barefoot light                on the sleeping land & sea.

The fearless blackbirds see me again

at the footpath beside the tall grasses

sprouting like unruly morning hair.

They caw and caw like vulgar boys

on street corners making love to girls

with their “hey mama

this” and their “hey mama that.”

But this gang of birds is much too slick.

They are my homeys of the air

with their mousse-backed hair and Crayola

black coats like small fry hoods who smoke

and joke about each other’s mothers,

virginal sisters, and the sweet arc of revenge.

These birds spurn my uneaten celery sticks,

feckless gestures, ineffective hosannas.

They tag one another, shrill and terrible,

caroling each to each my weekly wages.

But they let me pass, then flit away.

They won’t mess with me this time—

they know where I live.

But these, thy lovers are not dead.…They will rise up and hear your voice. . .. and run to kiss your mouth.


         –The Sphinx







In the garden of Père Lachaise,

city of the dead, we passed angels

covering their faces in shame,

& nineteenth-century trees, with tops bowed

as if their only purpose was to grieve,

& crossed the Transversales to Wilde’s grave.

 

When lovers leave, they leave their kisses

glistening on the gray slab,

on impressions of lips themselves,

a tissue of strangers’ cells

the conservators cannot leave alone,

& scrub the graffiti, as the plaque decrees

by law, no one can deface this tomb,

& still the images of lips remain,

dark gray stains of animal fat

imprisoned in limestone.

 

Lips are pressed as high as lovers

climb, against the Sphinx’s ridiculous

headdress, on the carved trumpet

of fame, & on the cheeks of its voracious face

of mindless passion flying with eyes pinched tight,

that some farsighted lover tried to open

with lines from a red pen, like a blepharoplasty,

while others kissed its sybaritic mouth

to make a poem a prophecy.

 

So here is love alive

surviving the wreckage it survives,

a lipstick envelope of hearts on their flight

to some other place, less aware,

more receiving, a final Champ de Grâce.

This is the poem of death.

There is only one

and no other.

 

Every one is an occasion,

one way or another,

and the last poem is this poem of death.

 

It is an occasion like no other.

I will no longer lope after elegance,

beauty’s body, or love’s wonder.

 

I will be sorry for everything

I was, and for everything I was not.

I speak to you as if you were my brother.

 

I will forgive everyone.

Death will make this possible.

There will be no other.

 

Death was in the mind

before thought or love,

in ourselves, and in our lovers.

 

The poem of death is speechless.

A companion will appear again

like another self, like your brother.

 

Enough now, enough has been said.

The spinning leaf will spin

like no other.

Nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel,

or what life itself eventually reveals.

 

No more studies of kindness or courtesy,

nor grace or charity, all is needless now.

 

All is needless now, sky, world, family

grieving for their bundles of purity,

 

now beyond disgrace, failure, winter streets,

or whatever attacks, and then retreats.

 

Classrooms emptied of children’s things,

paper and paste, and love’s imaginings,

 

bundles of peace, Christmas-blessed

with the unborn and the dead at rest,

 

nothing can reach you now, not lead or steel

or what life itself eventually reveals.

Among physicians rich in their death watch

In hallways crowded with locked wheelchairs,

Cradles of a century’s platitudes,

The stale air smelling of disinfectant

And weeping wounds enough to stupefy nurses,

Among the staring insomniacs of the day room,

The stroke victims on their rented gurneys,

Complaining orderlies and rattling carts

 

Among these in this place my father lay

At the end of everything

 

In the curved landscapes of white sheets

Abandoned finally by parents, his son,

 

The loyal company, old friends, his death

A sign of other deaths too soon to come

 

Unable to recall one life, his thoughts,

Features, he lay unknown to himself,

 

The tall hunter of pheasants out with his boy

In vellum corn and brassy orchards
